Green Stocks Analysis

Background:
After writing a script in VBA that functions properly we want to see if there is a better way to loop through all the data and in a shorter about of time. The code works for a dozen stocks, but we want it to work for thousands of stocks as well. To accomplish this task, we need to edit and refactor our code.

Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to edit and refactor previous code to make it more efficient. By editing and refactoring we will potentially have a faster run time and accomplish our wanted outcome quicker.

Results:
The stocks from the year 2017 did a great deal better than they did in the year 2018. In 2017, the return on all the stocks but one was above zero percent and therefore in green. From 2017 to 2018 the Total Daily Volume for each stock went down in numbers and the Return shows the decrease as well. Tickers DQ, HASI, RUN, SEDG, TERP, and VSLR had their total daily volumes increase from 2017 to 2018 but as a result, RUN and TERP were the only tickers that had an increase in return. Overall, we can say that the return for most tickers decreased from the year 2017 to 2018.
